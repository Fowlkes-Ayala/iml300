    <h1>THE QUESTION OF THESEUS’ SHIP</h1>
    <p class="hanging-indent">Premise 1. Substituting a small artificial component into an entity with rights, 
        if that component contributes identically to the entity’s psychology and does 
        not affect relevant social relationships, does not affect that entity’s rights.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="hanging-indent">
        Premise 2.The process described in Premise 1 could possibly be iterated in a way that transforms 
        a natural human being with rights into a wholly artificial being with the same rights.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="hanging-indent">
        Conclusion. Therefore, it is possible to create an artificial being with the 
        same rights as those of a natural human being.<br><br>
