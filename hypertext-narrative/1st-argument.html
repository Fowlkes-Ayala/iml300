    <h1>Possible AIs</h1>

    <p>The following declarations are quoted from an article by Eric Schwitzgebel and Mara Garza.</p>
    <p> Read it <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights.htm" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
    <p>
        Our main argument for <span class="ai-term">AI</span> rights is as follows:<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="hanging-indent">
        Premise 1. If Entity A deserves some particular degree of moral consideration<br>
        and Entity B does not deserve that same degree of moral<br>
        consideration, there must be some relevant difference between the two<br>
        entities that grounds this difference in moral status.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="hanging-indent">
        Premise 2. There are possible <span class="ai-term">AI</span>s who do not differ in any such relevant<br>
        respects from human beings.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="hanging-indent">
        Conclusion. Therefore, there are possible <span class="ai-term">AI</span>s who deserve a degree of<br>
        moral consideration similar to that of human beings.<br><br>
    </p>
