        Our main argument for AI rights is as follows:<br>
        Premise 1. If Entity A deserves some particular degree of moral consideration<br>
        and Entity B does not deserve that same degree of moral<br>
        consideration, there must be some relevant difference between the two<br>
        entities that grounds this difference in moral status.<br>
        Premise 2. There are possible AIs who do not differ in any such relevant<br>
        respects from human beings.<br>
        Conclusion. Therefore, there are possible AIs who deserve a degree of<br>
        moral consideration similar to that of human beings.<br>
