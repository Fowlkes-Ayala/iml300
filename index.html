      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Aya1a/full/3YF5HaRdM">AV Exercise</a>
      <p>
        "AV Exercise" intends to capture the electric feeling of running in cadence with a really good song. The site makes the run-speed responsive to the beats in the song and allows the user to play with the fidelity of the running character. The code uses a profile video of a runner, reads the RGB values of 10x10 "blocks" of pixels, translates those values into luminosity, and generates squares whose size is determined by the luminosity. Brighter areas produce bigger squares and darker areas produce smaller squares.
      </p>
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtiNv6QT4R8S9yFF92Tkr4ImazedKibuRmdw04jttWU/edit?usp=sharing">Concept Document</a><br />
      <a href="https://fowlkes-ayala.github.io/iml300/hypertext-narrative/index.html">A Defense for the Rights of [REDACTED]</a>
      <p>A "Defense for the Rights of Redacted" is an exploration of how terminological variations might influence user responses to moral questions. I undertook this project as an experiment in how the delivery of information can influence how people form opinions about it. Originally, I considered focusing this inquiry on variations in interface, but I realized constructing multiple unique interfaces for the website was probably out of scope, so I turned to a more simple variation: terminology. Throughout the website, the term “AI” is swapped with various alternatives such as “'Computational Lifeform” or “Neural Network.” The website focuses on the issue of AI rights, selected specifically for its future-facing nature. Audiences are mostly not arriving at this issue with preconceived notions, and particularly, they are not attaching an identity to “the type of person that believes X” versus “the type of person that believes Y.”</p>
      <h2>Project 3: Networked Care</h2>
      <a href="https://fowlkes-ayala.github.io/iml300/networked-care/index.html">AI CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR</a>
      <p>
        AI CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR responds to increasing alarm towards climate impacts of individual LLM use. In making this site, I uncovered a surprising outcome: that it’s entirely negligible. Even under the most pessimistic estimates with explosive use of LLMs, the carbon impact does not even approach a half-percent increase in the average American’s annual carbon footprint.
        Pivoting from my original purpose, the findings of this site remain important. It reveals that pointing the LLM climate-alarm at individuals is a fruitless diversion from more impactful climate accountability.

    <h1>Vibe Coding Experiments</h1>
    <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/7a18ca32-b5c7-4340-90b8-6698d8774076">Vibe Coding Experiment #1</a>
    <p>
      PROMPTS: Code a top-down 2D web game with a cute, chibi style avatar. For now, just make the control scheme, movement mechanics and environment. Don't include any other mechanics for now. Emulate the style of Night in the Woods.<br>
      Make this fox the avatar [image attached]
      No, I don't want you to convert my fox image into this vectorized shape avatar. Just put the actual png I gave you in the game.
    </p>
    <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/5b904432-e0f2-4126-98ad-3d9272256e83">Vibe Coding Experiment #2</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Design a website that intends to reveal its instruments of abstraction. It should make the user conscious of the wrapper that envelopes the website. It should make the user understand how the interface and the abstraction the website is bringing to the system, via its interface, is molding their understanding of that system. Just like how words mold our perception of our work and the world around us. Just like how maps mold our understanding of the world around us. This website should make clear how interface, too, is a frame that carries a filter along with it.
    </p>
    <a href="https://digital-dilemma-dance.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #3</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create a website that represent the tension between knowing that social media and internet-based existence is bad for you but it being so integrated into society and daily functioning that it's almost impossible to escape. Use an avant-garde format and don't restrict yourself to traditional web design principles
    </p>
    <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/3afe942f-d246-444a-a1a6-c150d308ba25">Vibe Coding Experiment #4</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Build a website that behaves like a living diary, exploring vulnerability, digital intimacy, and the blurry line between public and private selves. The homepage quietly asks the user to share something small: an emotion, a memory, a worry, and the site responds with its own confessional fragments, a loop of performed mutual disclosure. Pages shift between sincerity and performative oversharing, revealing how online spaces shape identity and self-mythology. Some sections display messages that feel like unpolished, raw drafts of emotional affirmations. Others explore loneliness, self-curation, and the pressure to be constantly visible. The site occasionally “interrupts” users with prompts about validation, boundaries, and the desire to be witnessed. Overall, it becomes a reflective, slightly uncomfortable space that asks what we choose to show, what we hide, and why we keep returning to digital platforms for connection and self-definition.
    </p>
    <a href="https://v0-computer-paradox-website.vercel.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #5</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Make a website that explores the paradoxical nature of computers: their ability to foster intimacy while simultaneously disrupting physical interaction and shared spaces. The site should be poetic and subtle with its messaging. The delivery of this message should happen through interaction and the way that users navigate it as opposed to them just being presented with the message.
    </p>
    <a href="https://inner-verse-shift.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #6</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create a website that reflects the notion that our internal world and mental understanding of reality is what shapes the external. This should be delivered through a nonlinear hypertext narrative and should be embedded into how the user navigates the site. Draw on the following quotes from Stephanie Dinkins about resisting oppression through change in perspective: "It is true these oppressive factors do not disappear in our material reality. But for a time, the mind can, in the name of self and community care, be less discouraged by outside forces to work toward that which sustains more holistically... What incremental changes do we make to our internal algorithms to lurch our way to ever-more confident means of thriving in this world? The question is not only what injustices are you fighting against, but what do you in your heart of hearts want to create?"
      The site does not have to and should not need to follow traditional web design principles. It should be experimental in nature"
    </p>
    <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/308ec641-9cd8-4db6-baff-b973293bd856">Vibe Coding Experiment #7</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create an interactive website that feels like a simple story-driven game. Players move through a short narrative and make choices that seem reasonable, giving them confidence that they understand what’s going on. At the end, reveal a key detail that shows they only saw one limited perspective. The twist should make players question their assumptions and notice how easily a single viewpoint can dominate their understanding. Draw thematic inspiration from “The Danger of a Single Story” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The narrative should connect to an international conflict, showing how distance, media, and selective information shape a player’s sense of who is right and who is wrong. The overall experience should feel reflective, unsettling, and grounded in the idea that every story has layers the player never saw.
    </p>
    <a href="https://v0-linguistic-diversity-website.vercel.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #8</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create a single-page website that celebrates the unique affordances of different languages. The page should feel warm, inclusive, and curious about how languages shape meaning in distinct ways. Highlight how certain ideas become clearer or richer when expressed in one language, and how translation can add depth rather than reduce it. Include examples or interactive elements that show how structure, rhythm, and cultural context influence expression. Make space for sign language as a full linguistic system, showing how movement, space, and gesture open possibilities that spoken or written forms cannot. The site should feel like an invitation to appreciate linguistic diversity and the creative potential that appears when moving between languages.
    </p>
    <a href="https://v0-live-synthesizer-site.vercel.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #9</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create a single-page live synthesizer site that pairs musical live coding with a simple, clearly labeled, beginner-friendly synth interface. The goal is to make live coding feel approachable by letting users interact in two ways: they can edit the code and hear the music change, or they can play with the synth controls and watch the code update in real time. The interface should map directly to key parts of the code so users can understand how each parameter affects the sound. All elements—the music engine, the code editor, and the synth controls—should stay fully synchronized. Any change in one area immediately updates the other two. The page should feel playful, intuitive, and designed to teach how live-coded music works through direct experimentation.
    </p>
    <a href="https://weaving-nodes.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #10</a>
    <p>
      PROMPT: Create a website that acts as an evolving, user-shaped archive exploring the connections between technology, identity, and collective feminist inquiry. The page invites users to browse digital artifacts that question who builds technology, who it empowers, and who it leaves out. Users can contribute short reflections or tags that influence how the archive rearranges itself, exploring the idea that knowledge online is never neutral and always in motion. The site should foreground community, accessibility, and critical curiosity. Include moments that expose the tensions between surveillance, autonomy, resistance, and visibility. The overall experience should feel like a living, decentralized index that encourages visitors to rethink the structures of the internet and imagine more equitable technological futures, echoing the spirit of cyberfeminist thought.

    <h1>Vibe Coding Reflection</h1>
    <p>My thoughts on vibe coding so far are that its potential still remains untapped. Because I don’t think any of us used it “right.” In my experience, effective AI outputs are highly dependent on a very strong vision from the artist. Strong AI works happen when the model is very intentionally steered towards a very specific vision, because in this case, the human is still in the deciding chair. The AI is only being used to do the grunt work necessary to see that vision through. Mediocre AI work is made when there is haze about the overall aim or form of the work, maybe it's still just an idea, and the AI becomes a copilot in the vision-making process. AI cannot make the vision. AI can only do the work. And at least for me, I did not spend the necessary time to carefully plan the project and iteratively refine the AI outputs to arrive at my vision, resulting in mediocre outcomes. I have yet to spend the time doing that, but I am confident that it could produce very worthwhile results.</p>
