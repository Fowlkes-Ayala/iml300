      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Aya1a/full/3YF5HaRdM">AV Exercise</a>
      <p>
        "AV Exercise" intends to capture the electric feeling of running in cadence with a really good song. The site makes the run-speed responsive to the beats in the song and allows the user to play with the fidelity of the running character. The code uses a profile video of a runner, reads the RGB values of 10x10 "blocks" of pixels, translates those values into luminosity, and generates squares whose size is determined by the luminosity. Brighter areas produce bigger squares and darker areas produce smaller squares.

      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtiNv6QT4R8S9yFF92Tkr4ImazedKibuRmdw04jttWU/edit?usp=sharing">Concept Document</a><br />
      <a href="https://fowlkes-ayala.github.io/iml300/hypertext-narrative/index.html">A Defense for the Rights of [REDACTED]</a>
      <p>A "Defense for the Rights of Redacted" is an exploration of how terminological variations might influence user responses to moral questions. I undertook this project as an experiment in how the delivery of information can influence how people form opinions about it. Originally, I considered focusing this inquiry on variations in interface, but I realized constructing multiple unique interfaces for the website was probably out of scope, so I turned to a more simple variation: terminology. Throughout the website, the term “AI” is swapped with various alternatives such as “'Computational Lifeform” or “Neural Network.” The website focuses on the issue of AI rights, selected specifically for its future-facing nature. Audiences are mostly not arriving at this issue with preconceived notions, and particularly, they are not attaching an identity to “the type of person that believes X” versus “the type of person that believes Y.”</p>
      <h2>Project 3: Networked Care</h2>
      <a href="https://fowlkes-ayala.github.io/iml300/networked-care/index.html">AI CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR</a>
      <p>
        AI CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR responds to increasing alarm towards climate impacts of individual LLM use. In making this site, I uncovered a surprising outcome: that it’s entirely negligible. Even under the most pessimistic estimates with explosive use of LLMs, the carbon impact does not even approach a half-percent increase in the average American’s annual carbon footprint.
        Pivoting from my original purpose, the findings of this site remain important. It reveals that pointing the LLM climate-alarm at individuals is a fruitless diversion from more impactful climate accountability.
