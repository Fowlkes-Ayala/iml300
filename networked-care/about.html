        <p id = "about-text">This website responds to increasing alarm towards climate impacts of individual LLM use. In making this site, I uncovered a surprising outcome: that it’s entirely negligible. Even under the most pessimistic estimates with explosive use of LLMs, the carbon impact does not even approach a half-percent increase in the average American’s annual carbon footprint.

            <br><br>Pivoting from my original purpose, the findings of this site remain important. It reveals that pointing the LLM climate-alarm at individuals is a fruitless diversion from more impactful climate accountability.
            
            <br><br>As someone who was personally concerned about the climate impact of their LLM use, I envision this website being similarly enlightening for anyone curious about uncovering the facts behind their use. View the “SOURCES” tab to understand where these numbers come from.
